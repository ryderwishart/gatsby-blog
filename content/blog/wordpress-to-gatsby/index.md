**TLDR:** A JAMStack site crushes Wordpress because one of these scales, and the other doesn't.

Completely jammed up, lagged out, flat out not working. ðŸ˜–

Ever opened your **frontend editor**, whether that's Squarespace, Wix, a premium Wordpress pluginâ€”or whateverâ€”and experience it?

If I ever break my femur, I'll try to do a squat, just to see which is more painful.

Just kidding? ðŸ˜…

Maybe you're making an "utimate guide" for some topic as part of your content marketing strategy, and you hit a critical mass of content and the browser just can't seem to handle what you are putting it through.

Heck, I even experience this problem with Microsoft Word. 

After a certain number of pages (usually a couple hundred, not uncommon for a manuscript), it just stops working. 

A fellow PhD student told me that in the final days of his dissertation revisions **it would take over a minute for Word to just save his file**. It's painfully frustrating.

Well, this frontend log-jam bogged me down this morning.

## The checklist I never finish writing

I've been working on this ultimate SEO checklist for months now. 

I keep putting it off, and then later I come back to it, thinking,

>Why did I stop working on that?" 

Of course, five minutes into using my Wordpress frontend editor and it all came back to me: it's just impossible to get anything done!

Now I am seriously considering migrating my digital marketing business's website to Gatsby.js.

## You know it. I know it. JAMStack *is* It

I've made a few JAMStack sites for clients recently using some Gatsby starters. I deploy them using Netlify, and all I can say is, "wow."

JAMStack sites use static HTML files, so there is no PHP involved, no backend, and in the case of Netlify, **continuous deployment and no server**! ðŸ¤©

It's **ultimate security**, **ultimate speed** (seriously, you get local speeds), and, best of all, you can **do all your editing in a text editor**.

Using a text editor really seals the deal as far as I'm concerned. What could be simpler, or more reliable?

## The Plan

I'm going to migrate my business site, [truemarketing.ca](https://truemarketing.ca/) to a JAMStack site.

Of course, I'll be using Gatsby. While I could try to use a [headless CMS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/headless-cms/), I think I want to keep my workflow completely local.

I will probably use MDX (markdown with JSXâ€”which in turn is extended JavaScript), but I've got a few options I'll explore. 

Either way, I am pumped âœŠ to ditch my clunky Wordpress frontend.

If you're pumped about Gatsby.js too, share this post to Twitter with the [#gatsbyjs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gatsbyjs) hashtag!

Here's a nify quote you can use, too:
